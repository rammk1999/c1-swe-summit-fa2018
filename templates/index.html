This webpage displays some data visualizations and supporting analysis from a data set representing an eight month period of recorded bike sharing data in the city of Los Angeles. From this data I generated 6 graphs which answer various questions and showcase interesting trends in the data. Additionally, there is a prediction widget, that calculates how long someone will be using a bike, given a time and certain gps coordinates. </h2>

                  Average Distance Travelled: 4.1951 Miles || Average Speed: 14.4353 Miles/Hr
                  <br> It is quite simple to solve for the average distance and speed of a one-way trip. However, finding the average distance travelled for round-trips proved much more challenging. In order to find the average distance for a one-way trip, the distance between the starting and ending gps coordinates was calculated (in miles) using the Haversine forumla. Then the speed was calculated by dividing the distance by the trip duration. But for round trips, calculating the average distance travelled involved multiplying the duration of the trip by a standard average speed. This standard average speed was calculated by using all trips where the duration was within 3 standard deviations of the average (in order to eliminate outliers). Then I used this average speed and applied it on Round-Trips to find the distance travelled.

              <p class="mb-5">This graph displays the ten most used starting stations. As seen in the bar plots, stations 3069 and 3030 are the most used in terms of starting trips. Over the duration of time the data was collected, approximately 5138 rides started from station 3069 and approximately 5059 rides started from station 3030. Looking at the metro bike share stations data set quickly reveals that these two stations are near very import landmarks. Station 3069 is located at the intersection of Broadway and Third, an area that is close to popular attractions such as the Million Dollar Theater, and also near the center of the city. Station 3030 is located on Main and First. Similar to station 3069, 3030 is also located in a heavily crowded area. Important areas such as Grand Park, Los Angeles Mall, and the LAPD Headquarters are all within one to two blocks of this bike station, and that explains the heavy usage.</p>

              <p class="mb-5">This bar plot displays the ten most used ending stations. Immediately, the most noticable trait in this graph is that station 3005 is clearly the most used ending station. Over the course of time the data was collected, station 3005 was the ending destination for 6262 trips. Which is over 700 more than the next closest ending destination. Once again, the location of this station explains its high usage. Located on Seventh and Flower, station 3005 is a frequent ending destination because it is very close to many restaurants and more importantly, several apartment complexes are within one to two blocks of the station. The fact that station 3005 is not in the heart of the city, in conjuction with the close proximity of several apartment complexes, explains why this station is the most popular end destination.</p>

Frequent and Infrequent users were identified by whether or not a specific ride was labelled as a one-time occurrence. Walk-Ups consisted of 31.13% of all total bike rides, whereas monthly passes make up 61.395% of all bike rides. Looking at the graph on the right hand side, out of all the rides collected in the data set, 41224 of them were Walk-Ups, and 91203 rides came from frequent users. In conclusion 68.870% of all the rides came from users who use bike sharing reguarly. There are people who own a monthly pass, a flex pass, or are considered staff. </p>

In this plot month 1 is July, and month 9 is March. By analyzing the graph, it is clear that August had the most rides, but after that, the lines start to decrease. This can be explained by the colder weather in winter, which causes people to not bike as much and either drive or take public transit instead. However, at the tail end of the graph, a jump can be seen. This is expected because during the arrival of spring, citizens start going outside more and are more likely to use bike sharing. Interestingly, despite the total number of rides changing every month, the proportion of frequent and infrequent users keeps steady throughout most of the year. This absence of variance could be potentially explained by the lack of data for the summer months. During summer, many tourists would probably use bike sharing, and would most likely be considered Walk-Up occurrences, which would have increased the number of commuters who don't regularly use bike sharing.</p>

              <p class="mb-5">This graph displays the stations with the most displaced bikes per day. This metric was calculated by finding the differene between the amount of time a station was selected as the start and the amount of time a station was the end of a trip, then dividing that difference by the total number of days in the dataset. After performing this calculation and displaying the results, it is clear that stations 3005 and stations 3042 usually have an excess of bikes at the end of the day. Station 3005 has approximately 5.15 more bikes at it's station at the end of the day than at the beginning, and station 3042 has about 4.78 more bikes. Based on earlier visualizations, it's of no surprise that station 3005 gains more bikes. But why would station 3042 gain more bikes? Station 3042 is located on First and Central, which is, like station 3005, not located in the center of the city. This area has many restaurants and attractions to see however, and that could possibly explain why there is a net gain of bikes on average per day. In order to make sure travel patterns are matched, bikes should be moved in the late night, or early morning, back to areas where they are very heavily used. Based on previous visualizations stations 3069 and 3030 are solid choices because those stations are where bikers are most likely to start their trips from. </p>

              <p class="mb-5">In order to further explore the data with regards to bike displacement, this heat plot shows where bikes at stations 3005 and 3042 (the stations with the most gained bikes per day) come from. As seen in these heatplots, trips that end at station 3005 usually start from around (34.045,-118.20525). Trips that end at station 3042 start from around (34.0525, -118.2045). Building off the previous assesement of the net change of bikes, excess bikes at stations 3005 and 3042 could be moved back to stations near the two coordinates mentioned before in order to accomodate the trends of riders. </p>
